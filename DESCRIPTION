Description: Provides systematic geometry-adaptive parameter optimization with 
    statistical validation for experimental biological data. Combines ANOVA-based 
    validation with systematic constraint configuration testing (log-scale, 
    positive domain, Euclidean) through T,P,E testing. Only proceeds with 
    parameter optimization when statistically significant biological effects 
    are detected, preventing over-fitting to noise. Uses 'GALAHAD' trust region methods with constraint projection from Conn et al. (2000) 
    <doi:10.1137/S1052623497325107>, ANOVA-based validation following Fisher 
    (1925) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-4380-9_6>, and effect size calculations 
    per Cohen (1988, ISBN:0805802835). Designed for structured experimental 
    data including kinetic curves, dose-response studies, and treatment 
    comparisons where appropriate parameter constraints and statistical 
    justification are important for meaningful biological interpretation. 
    Developed at the Minnesota Center for Prion Research and Outreach at
